## Samples

Each directory in this repo is a sample Temporal project built with the [TypeScript SDK](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/typescript/introduction/).

- The fastest way to try these out is starting Temporal and running these samples in the browser:
  - Gitpod: [One click to try](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/) (there is a good free tier)
  - [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace) (if your org admin has enabled this) - [90 second video demo](https://youtu.be/FdEQQC9EdfU)
- To run these samples locally, go through the prerequisites listed in our [Getting Started docs](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/typescript/introduction#getting-started).
